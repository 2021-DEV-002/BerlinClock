## Pr√©-requisite :

You will need the latest version of Xcode to run this project. 

## How to run ? 

To try the Demo App you need to :

- Select the Scheme BerlinClockUI 
- Select the device you want to run the app into.

## How to run Tests ? 

I advice to run the following command, this command will run all tests one after one.
```sh
xcodebuild -scheme "BerlinClockUITests" -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS,name=iPhone 12 Pro Max (14.2) ' test
```

Notes : I used a simulator to run my test, please check that you have the same as i used or change its name to what ever you want.

Enjoy :)
